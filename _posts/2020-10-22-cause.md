## Brief

Messaging and mobile calls have become an essential means of communication these days, and almost everyone owns a smartphone. A survey shows that over 500 million Indians use smartphones, among which 77% of users are online. However, older people seem to be the neglected user group in the design of mobile devices and services.
Given the current trend, older people are also shifting towards using mobile phones and messaging apps to stay in touch with their loved ones. It is well-known that most of the older generation have innate difficulty in understanding and operating the complex functionalities of smartphones.
We pursued this problem and talked to some older people to find out what causes difficulty for them to operate smartphones. The primary cause we found is:

### Endless functions in the smartphone nowadays
Today, there are endless applications and functions on a smartphone. Even the current generation doesn't know about every function, and then for the elderly people, it becomes a worse condition as they use only 3-4 applications in mobile phones. The elderly's difficulties in getting acquainted with smartphones are due to the complexity of interface design and navigability, the quantity of information displayed on the screen, and the number of functions that do not suit their needs. And because of all these reasons, they depend on their family members for operating mobiles.
