Nowadays, there has been an enormous increase in the use of digital technology, especially smartphones. However, the elder generation has also started getting familiar with this to-date technology. But the elder generation comparatively works on smartphones for a short period of time, i.e., once in the morning, once in the afternoon, and then in the evening, a total of approximately two hours. The primary purpose of working on mobiles is to connect with family members and then execute some everyday scheduled work. However, there are many points that the elders are hesitant in using the mobiles for a longer duration. Following are the points of context from the elderly perspective:
 
### Too many Functionalities

It would be great if they get to see the applications which they frequently use on the phone rather than seeing too many apps, which reduces their confidence in using mobile phones. The launcher should allow them to select the apps which they frequently use, like Calling app, Contact, Calculator, Camera, and WhatsApp.

### Default Language

We need to ensure that the launcher provides the option of changing the language from English to their native language, which they use in their daily lives. 

### Font Size & Themes

Due to aging, elders have an eyesight issue because of which they are unable to read properly. For this, they need an option of changing the font size of the text, and it should help the elders to read the text easily and also, the option of setting bright or dark themes according to their choice.

### Video Guide

It will be beneficial for the elderly if there is a tutorial video on their phone, which they can see whenever they face any problem using mobile. This way, they will feel more independent as then they will not depend on their family members for small queries.

### Login Information

There should be some feature in the launcher, which should store the passwords and user ID so that the elderly need not remember them.
