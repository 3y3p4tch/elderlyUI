The most important part of any product is it's connection with the consumers. The connection is made only when the user is satisfied with the product and begins to cherish it, which creates a demand of the product. 

Consumer satisfaction makes the winning product and completes the most important criterion for innovation.

We talked with a few customers about their experiences with the launcher. A general response is listed below.

<h3>Q. How comfortable are you using our launcher?</h3>
<p>Ans. This launcher is exactly what I needed. We used to have issues telling the time or checking remaining battery power. Opening apps was also a bit difficult as I had to tap on smaller app icons with my shaking hands. This launcher improves our experience quite a bit. The app icons are large, battery icons and time are shown in large fonts which makes them easier to see, and contact management is also made quite easy with some frequent contacts on the home screen. The theme is also pretty clean and easy on the eyes.</p>

<h3>Q. If you wanted to change anything in the current launcher, what would you change?</h3>
<p>Ans. I usually like to read newspapers and nowadays it seems that news is also available through the internet. If only I could also have an easy way to read the latest day-to-day news, it would be better. Rest all is great.</p>

<h3>Q. How likely are you to recommend this launcher to your other elderly friends?</h3>
<p>Ans. The launcher seems pretty great and it eases our day-to-day use cases. Iâ€™d highly recommend this to anyone who has difficulty working with smartphones but only uses some common day to day activities.</p>
