Now we arrive at the ideas to overcome the problems discussed above.

<h2>Home Screen</h2>
<b>Concept 1:</b> We focussed on having only essential apps on the home screen for easy navigating for the elderly. The essential apps include Calling, Contacts, Messaging, Gallery, Camera and an All Apps icon, along with the time and battery left in mobile in large font.

<b>Concept 2:</b> Then we came up with the idea of having an emergency calling and Settings option and the all apps option as a horizontal bar at the bottom in order to fit in all the important applications.

</div>

<b>Concept 3:</b> Considering the need of Calling app, we came up with the design of having Apps option and Contacts option as a slide view on the Home screen. The battery symbol was also elongated in horizontal direction as it reduces strain on eyes on seeing the battery level.

The Contacts option shows the frequently contacts on the top and voice search option is available so there is no effort in typing the name.

<h2>All Apps option</h2>
<b>Concept 1:</b> The apps under the All Apps option are shown as a list with their icons and names in large text.

</div>

<b>Concept 2:</b> The apps under the All Apps option are shown only with their large colored icons and its name in small text.

<h2>Keypad</h2>
The general qwerty keypad is replaced with the <b>alphabetical keypad</b>, i.e. the letters are arranged alphabetically, thus leading to less difficulty in spotting the letters by the elderly. An option of <b>Change Language</b> is provided which consists of the native language of the elderly, in order to chat freely with their closed ones in their native language. Also, considering the strain on the eyes while working on mobile phones, we have <b>increased the size of the keypad alphabets</b>.

<h2>Settings App</h2>
Original Settings apps have over 19 headings and 120+ sub-headings out of which over ~75% of them are of no use to the elderly therefore we have our own simplified version of the settings menu for easier navigation
<b>Concept 1:</b> The listed version of the settings app.

</div>

<b>Concept 2:</b> The symbolized version of the settings app.

<h2>Lock Screen</h2>
The lock screen contains the day, date and time. Other than this, it contains the torch and camera. The <b>torch</b> is placed on the lock screen as elderly most of the time don’t find it easily and when their power cuts they face a lot of problems or they need it to search many things at home.

</div>

<h2>Contacts App</h2>
We have given <b>only three options</b> under Contacts of Search, Save and Edit contact, thus removing all the other unnecessary options.
The <b>Search Contacts</b> option features only <b>four contacts at a time</b> to ensure easy visibility. The first option of Favourites consists of all the frequently contacted people.
The options of <b>Edit and Save Contact</b> consist of only the <b>Name and Number feature</b>, thus removing all the unnecessary extra things asked in today’s smartphones.
We also ensure to keep the <b>font size of numbers</b> on the dialing keypad to be large so the elderly don’t face difficulty in dialing a number.

<h2>Messaging App</h2>
The <b>font size is increased</b> so the elderly do not have to strain their eyes to find and type the letters. The keypad consists of an option from where the elderly can <b>change the language</b> of the keypad and thus, can chat freely in their native language.
